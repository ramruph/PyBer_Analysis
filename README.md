# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to show the total weekly fares for each city type. 


# Results

For almost every category from Total Ride, Driver Count, and Fares goes from Rural areas having the least to the urban areas having the most. This would correlate with the fact that in city areas ride share would be more prominent and in the areas more spaced out the density of population is less and that would mean that less people would need 

# Summary

Focus on the majority of PyBer ride sharing in areas with greater population density. Rural areas will reuqire less cars present, but urban areas will have a higher demand and more money will be made there. The focus should trickle down from Urban being the more important to rural being least important.
